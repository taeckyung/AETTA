# AETTA: Label-Free Accuracy Estimation for Test-Time Adaptation (CVPR '24)

This is the PyTorch Implementation of "AETTA: Label-Free Accuracy Estimation for Test-Time Adaptation (CVPR '24)" by [Taeckyung Lee](https://taeckyung.github.io/), Sorn Chottananurak, [Taesik Gong](https://taesikgong.com/), and [Sung-Ju Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/).

## Installation Guide

1. Download or clone our repository
2. Set up a python environment using conda (see below)
3. Prepare datasets (see below)
4. Run the code (see below)

## Python Environment

We use [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/).
You can get conda by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) first.

We share our python environment that contains all required python packages. Please refer to the `./aetta.yml` file

You can import our environment using conda:

    conda env create -f aetta.yml -n aetta

Reference: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

## Prepare Datasets

To run our codes, you first need to download at least one of the datasets. Run the following commands:

    $cd .                           #project root
    $. download_cifar10c.sh        #download CIFAR10/CIFAR10-C datasets
    $. download_cifar100c.sh       #download CIFAR100/CIFAR100-C datasets

Also, you can download ImageNet-C at: https://zenodo.org/record/2235448 

## Run

### Prepare Source model

"Source model" refers to a model that is trained with the source (clean) data only. Source models are required to all methods to perform test-time adaptation. You can generate source models via:

    $. train_src.sh                 #generate source models for CIFAR10 as default.

You can specify which dataset to use in the script file.

### Run Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) & Estimate Accuracy

Given source models are available, you can run TTA via:

    $. tta.sh                       #Run online CIFAR10 as default.

You can specify which dataset and which method in the script file.

## Log

### Raw logs

In addition to console outputs, the result will be saved as a log file with the following structure: `./log/{DATASET}/{METHOD}_outdist/{TGT}/{LOG_PREFIX}_{SEED}_{DIST}/online_eval.json`

### Obtaining results

In order to print the accuracy estimation mean-absolute-errors(%) of AETTA, run the following commands:

    $python print_est.py --dataset cifar10outdist --target aetta    #print the result of the specified condition.

Check `print_est.py` for further command-line arguments.
